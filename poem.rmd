## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
Inscribed to a Dear Child:  
In Memory of Golden Summer Hours  
And Whispers of a Summer Sea  


Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task,  
Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well  
Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask  
The tale he loves to tell.  
  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow.     

My little horse must think it queer  
  
## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
